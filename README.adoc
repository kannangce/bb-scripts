## bb-scripts

This project is meant to contain the utility scripts written in Clojure, meant to run on https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka], a GraalVM utility to run Clojure.
Since babashka is available for Mac, Windows and Unix environment, this scripts can be used in all of those environments.

## Pre-requisite:

You'll be required to have babashka(bb) installed in your system to make use of the scripts in this.

## Purpose:

A couple of reasons,

- Based on the different project requirements, I'm required to work across different OS, I miss certain commands, especially, when I have to work on Windows.
- At times I need certain utilities which are not commonly avaialble, so thought of building it on my own.

## Setup:

Once you have `bb` setup, configure your `source-bb-utils-<os>.sh` so that it can be loaded automatically (from `bashrc`, `zshrc`, etc.).

For example, you might required to add `source source-bb-utils-<os>.sh` in your `*rc` or `*profile` files.
